Computed fields allow you to derive a new field based on existing data. A common example is when you compute a full name from a first and last name. In your database, you may only store the first and last name, but you can define a function that computes a full name by combining the first and last name. This field is read-only and stored in your application's memory, not in your database.

## Deriving a Full Name using a Prisma Client extension

Prisma Client extensions allow you to define type-safe computed fields. The fields are not stored in the database but are computed at runtime.

Client extensions is currently in preview. To enable the `clientExtensions` Preview feature, add the `clientExtensions` feature flag to the `previewFeatures` field of the `generator` block in your Prisma schema file:

```prisma file=schema.prisma highlight=3;add
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["clientExtensions"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Here's an example of how an extension that computes a full name might look like:

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="Prisma Client extension" icon="code"/>, <FileWithIcon text="Prisma Schema" icon="code"/>]}>

<tab>

```ts highlight={2-13};add
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  result: {
    user: {
      fullName: {
        needs: { firstName: true, lastName: true },
        compute(user) {
          return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

</tab>

<tab>

```prisma
model User {
  id        Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  email     String @unique
  firstName String
  lastName  String
  password  String

  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean  @default(false)

  authorId Int?
  author   User? @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
}
```

</tab>

</TabbedContent>

Here's an example query:

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: {
    id: 1,
  },
})
```

The returned object will contain the `fullName` property. Any other read query to your database will also contain the `fullName` property.

## Deriving a Full Name using a custom function

You can define a function that accepts a generic as an input then extend that generic to ensure it conforms to a specific structure. Finally, you can return that generic with additional computed fields. Let's see how that might look:

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="TypeScript" icon="code"/>, <FileWithIcon text="JavaScript" icon="code"/>]}>

<tab>

```tsx
// Define a type that needs a first and last name
type FirstLastName = {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
}

// Extend the T generic with the fullName attribute
type WithFullName<T> = T & {
  fullName: string
}

// Take objects that satisfy FirstLastName and computes a full name
function computeFullName<User extends FirstLastName>(
  user: User
): WithFullName<User> {
  return {
    ...user,
    fullName: user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName,
  }
}

async function main() {
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: 1 })
  const userWithFullName = computeFullName(user)
}
```

</tab>

<tab>

```js
function computeFullName(user) {
  return {
    ...user,
    fullName: user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName,
  }
}

async function main() {
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: 1 })
  const userWithFullName = computeFullName(user)
}
```

</tab>

</TabbedContent>

In the TypeScript example above, a `User` generic has been defined that extends the `FirstLastName` type. This means that whatever you pass into `computeFullName` must contain `firstName` and `lastName` keys.

A `WithFullName<User>` return type has also been defined, which takes whatever `User` is and tacks on a `fullName` string attribute.

With this function, any object that contains `firstName` and `lastName` keys can compute a `fullName`. Pretty neat, right?

## Going Further

- Learn how you can move the `computeFullName` function into [a custom model](/concepts/components/prisma-client/custom-models).
- There's an [outstanding feature request](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3394) to add native support to Prisma Client. If you'd like to see that happen, make sure to upvote that issue and share your use case!
