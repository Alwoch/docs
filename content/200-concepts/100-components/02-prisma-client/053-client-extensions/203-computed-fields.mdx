<TopBlock>

Computed fields allow you to derive a new field based on existing data. A common example is when you compute a full name from a first and last name. In your database, you may only store the first and last name, but you can define a function that computes a full name by combining the first and last name. This field is read-only and stored in your application's memory, not in your database.

Before you create Prisma Client extensions, you must enable the `clientExtensions` feature flag in the `generator` block of your `schema.prisma` file, as follows:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["clientExtensions"]
}
```

The Preview feature is available from v4.7.0 and higher.

The following extension creates a computed field called `fullName`:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends({
  result: {
    user: {
      fullName: {
        needs: { firstName: true, lastName: true },
        compute(user) {
          return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`
        },
      },
    },
  },
})

// Example query
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: {
    id: 1,
  },
})
```

Example output:

```no-lines
{
  id: 1,
  email: 'alice@prisma.io',
  firstName: 'Alice',
  lastName: 'Jackson',
  fullName: 'Alice Jackson'
}
```

The returned objects will contain the `fullName` property. All read queries on the `User` model will also contain the `fullName` property included in the response and the inferred types.

The example is based on the following sample schema:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["clientExtensions"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean @default(false)

  user     User? @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId Int?
}

model User {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email     String  @unique
  firstName String?
  lastName  String?

  posts Post[]
}
```
