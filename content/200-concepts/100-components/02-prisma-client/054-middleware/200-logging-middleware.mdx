The following example logs the time taken for a Prisma Query to run:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient()

prisma.$use(async (params, next) => {
  const before = Date.now()

  const result = await next(params)

  const after = Date.now()

  console.log(`Query ${params.model}.${params.action} took ${after - before}ms`)

  return result
})

const create = await prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    title: 'Welcome to Prisma Day 2020',
  },
})

const createAgain = await prisma.post.create({
  data: {
    title: 'All about database collation',
  },
})
```

Example output:

```no-lines
Query Post.create took 92ms
Query Post.create took 15ms
```

The example is based on the following sample schema:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean @default(false)

  user     User? @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId Int?
}

model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String?
  email String  @unique

  posts Post[]
}
```

You can also use [Prisma Client extensions](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions) to log the time take to perform a query. You can see the example here: [Extension sample: logging](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/logging)
